# BreatheOut
The lack of understanding from peers to a child with asthma, often affects the child negatively. Children with asthma often feel frustrated with their medicine and excluded from their peers. In the field of human-computer interaction, many studies focus on mobile applications for monitoring and reporting asthma data for the asthma patient. Other studies focus on teaching children with asthma about their disease. Few to none studies focus on supporting the inclusion of children with asthma. 

In this paper, we present Breathe Out, a breath-based interactive game that supports learning about asthma through prerequisites gained from ‘The Five Characteristics of Learning Through Play’ model. We have evaluated Breathe Out with 47 children, where 17% of the children have asthma. We found that Breathe Out taught both children with and without asthma, about the disease. Our study highlights the potential of technology facilitating a conversation about asthma, which could potentially make the children with asthma feel more included among their peers.

The prototype game is coded in C# in Unity while the Breathe Controller is coded and controlled in Arduino.IDE.
